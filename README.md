   installed : v16.15.0 (with npm 8.5.5)

Note: the node command changed location and the old location may be remembered in your current shell.
         old : /usr/bin/node
         new : /usr/local/bin/node
If "node --version" shows the old version then start a new shell, or reset the location hash with:
hash -r  (for bash, zsh, ash, dash, and ksh)
rehash   (for csh and tcsh)
